  <b>What is HTML</b>
  <p>HTML is a file type that most of the web uses. HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. You can look at the HTML on a webpage by right clicking then pressing "Inspect Elements" if using chrome. This is a very quick note of HTML, but you can
    go much more in-depth into what HTML is with a little research.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Tags</b>
    <p>Lots of the focus of this lessons was about different tags and what they do. A few of the tags we learned were: b, em, a, img, br, and p. tags are the invisble text that formats the page that the final product looks like.</p>
    <br>
    <b>Elements</b>
    <p>We didn't go over much about elements but with my personal research I found that a element is when the line of code or tag has been opened and closed, or otherwise you could say the completed line of code. My source of this was <a href=www.w3school.com>www.w3school.com</a>
      <p>
        <br>
        <b>Inline and Block</b>
        <p>Inline and Block are 2 types of elements, one being block and one being inline. The meaning of inline as I know it is when the tect or element will have white space around it. Block though has a square around the element allowing for customization
          around the element as a inline doesn't.</p>
        <br>
        <b>Span and Div</b>
        <p>Spand and Div are 2 elements that both contain content but Span is inline and Div is block. I was told by my dad who works in some web devolpment, that Div is a very important element in HTML as he showed me an eample of some HTML code he is looking
          through.</p>
